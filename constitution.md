    ANNEXURE A.

Since it pleased Almighty God, by his Holy Spirit, to call certain of his servants to unite here in 1972, under the name Brackenhurst Baptist Church, for the worship of God and the spread of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and since he has seen fit to sustain and prosper this work to the present day, we do hereby adopt this Constitution as our articles of governance, to be interpreted at all times to reflect the character of and bring glory to Jesus Christ, as revealed in the Holy Bible and articulated in the standards set forth in the statement of faith and church covenant included herein.
NAME
The name and designation of the church is BRACKENHURST BAPTIST CHURCH (for the purposes of this constitution, hereinafter called “the church”).
PURPOSE
The church exists by the grace of God and for the glory of God, which is its ultimate purpose in all activities. The church glorifies God by loving him and obeying his commands; by worshipping him according to biblical order; by equipping the saints through biblical instruction and study; by proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ through preaching, personal evangelism, and any other means consistent with the teachings of holy Scripture; by encouraging, supporting, and participating in local, domestic, and international missions work; by administering the ordinances of baptism and Communion; by encouraging biblical fellowship among believers; by serving individuals, families, and churches by providing for physical, emotional, and spiritual needs in the name of Jesus Christ; and by encouraging sister churches to biblical faithfulness and purity through instruction and encouragement about the nature of the local church.
CHURCH GOVERNMENT
The church acknowledges Jesus Christ as the supreme Head of the church, and claims the scriptural right of complete autonomy and self-government; undertakes to manage all of its affairs according to New Testament teaching; and recognises the final authority of the holy Scriptures in all matters of faith and conduct.
AFFILIATION
While the church remains independent and is not affiliated or aligned with the Baptist World Alliance or the Baptist Union of Southern Africa, the church does maintain active fellowship with other churches of like faith, and reserves the right, with the approval of its members, to affiliate itself with churches and church associations of likeminded faith and practice.
DECLARATION OF BELIEF
Members of the church must be believers, who have been baptised upon a profession of faith, and who affirm the teachings of the church as outlined below.
The Scriptures. We believe that the Holy Bible was, in its original writings, divinely inspired and that it is a perfect treasure of heavenly instruction. God is its author, salvation is its purpose, and truth, without any mixture of error, is its content. Scripture is now, and will be to the end of the world, the true centre of Christian union and the supreme standard for evaluating all human conduct, creeds, and opinions.
The True God. We believe that there is only one living and true God. He is revealed in the Bible as the Creator and supreme Ruler of all that is. He is inexpressibly glorious in holiness and is worthy of all possible honour, confidence, and love. In the unity of the Godhead there are three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are equal in every divine perfection and carry out distinct but harmonious offices in the great work of redemption.
Humanity and the Fall. We believe that humanity is the special creation of God, uniquely made in his own image and therefore with inherent dignity. God created humans male and female as the crowning work of his creation. The gift of gender is a part of the goodness of God’s creation. Marriage is the uniting of one natural man to one natural woman in covenant commitment for a lifetime, a gift that models the way God relates to his people. God created the human race in holiness under his law. By voluntary transgression, humanity fell from that holy and happy state. As a result, all people are now sinners, not by external compulsion but by choice. By nature, humans entirely lack the holiness that is required by the law of God and are actively inclined to evil. Therefore, they are under just condemnation to a sentence of eternal destruction, without defence or excuse.
The Way of Salvation. We believe that the salvation of God’s people is completely by grace, through the mediatorial offices of the Son of God. By the appointment of the Father, he freely took to himself our nature, born of a virgin as a human being, but without sin. He honoured the divine law by his personal obedience and made full atonement for our sins by his substitutionary death, satisfying God’s wrath. He rose from the dead, according to the scriptures, and is now enthroned in heaven. Jesus, the Son, unites in his wonderful person the tenderest sympathies with divine perfections and, as such, is qualified in every way to be a suitable, compassionate, and all-sufficient Saviour.
Justification. We believe that, in the gospel, Jesus Christ fully justifies those who believe in him. Justification includes the pardon of sin, righteous standing before God and his people, and the promise of eternal life founded on principles of righteousness. We are not justified because of any personal works of righteousness but only through faith in Christ’s finished work. By virtue of this faith, his perfect righteousness is freely imputed to us by God’s grace alone. Justification immediately brings us into a state of most blessed peace and favour with God, and secures every other blessing we need for time and eternity.
The Freeness of Salvation. We believe that the blessings of salvation are made free to all by the gospel. It is the immediate duty of all to accept them by a heartfelt, penitent, and obedient faith. Preventing this salvation is every sinner’s inherent depravity and rejection of the gospel, a rejection that aggravates a sinner’s condemnation.
Grace in Regeneration. We believe that sinners must be born again (regenerated) in order to be saved. Regeneration is accomplished in a way that is beyond our comprehension. It is carried out by the power of the Holy Spirit, using divine truth to obtain our voluntary obedience to the gospel. The proper evidence of regeneration appears in the holy fruits of repentance, faith, and newness of life.
Repentance and Faith. We believe that repentance and faith are sacred duties and inseparable graces. They are produced in our souls by the regenerating Spirit of God, who convinces us of our guilt, danger, helplessness, and the way of salvation by Christ. They consist of turning away from out sin to God with genuine sorrow, confession, and a petition for mercy; receiving heartily the Lord Jesus Christ as Prophet, Priest and King; and relying on him alone as the only and all-sufficient Saviour.
God’s Purpose of Grace. We believe that election is the eternal purpose of God according to which he graciously regenerates, sanctifies, and saves sinners. Election is consistent with human free agency and includes all the means necessary to achieve God’s purpose. It is a most glorious display of God’s sovereign goodness, which is infinitely free, wise, holy, and unchangeable. Election completely rules out boasting and promotes humility, love, prayer, praise, trust in God, and the active imitation of his free mercy. It encourages the greatest possible exercise of human responsibility. The election of individuals to life may be confirmed by its effects in everyone who truly believes the gospel. Election is the foundation of Christian assurance, and confirming our election deserves our greatest diligence.
Sanctification. We believe that sanctification is the process by which we are made partakers of God’s holiness, according to his purpose. Sanctification is a progressive work. It begins in regeneration and continues in the hearts of believers by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit and by God’s appointed means. These means include the word of God, self-examination, self-denial, watchfulness, prayer, and the oversight and fellowship of the local church.
The Preservation of Saints. We believe that all genuine believers, by God’s preserving grace, will endure to the end. Their persevering obedience to Christ and attachment to his people are the primary mark distinguishing them from superficial professors. A special providence watches over their welfare, and they are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation.
The Harmony of the Law and the Gospel. We believe the law of God is the eternal and unchangeable rule of his moral governance. It is holy, just, and good. Fallen human beings are unable to fulfil the precepts of the law, which the Scriptures attribute entirely to their love of sin. A chief purpose of the gospel is to deliver people from this love and to restore them through a mediator to a sincere obedience to the holy law. The visible church’s means of grace share this great purpose.
A Gospel Church. We believe that a visible church of Christ is a congregation of believers, baptised upon a profession of faith, joined together by covenant in the faith and fellowship of the gospel. A visible church observes the ordinances of Christ, submits to his laws, and exercises the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by his word. The only scriptural officers of the church are elders (also called overseers or pastors) and deacons, whose qualifications and duties are defined in the epistles to Timothy and Titus.
Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. We believe that Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is a solemn and beautiful emblem that declares our faith in the crucified, buried, and risen Saviour as well as our union with him in death to sin and resurrection to a new life. Baptism is a prerequisite to the privileges of church membership and the Lord’s Supper. We likewise believe that the Supper is a divinely-appointed means of grace whereby members of a local church, following earnest self-examination, use bread and the cup in a sacred manner to commemorate together the death of Jesus Christ. The ordinances belong to the gathered church, marking off believers from unbelievers and making the church visible on earth.
The Lord’s Day. We believe the first day of the week (Sunday) is the Lord’s Day. It is a Christian institution for regular observance. It commemorates the resurrection of Christ from the dead and points to the eternal rest that awaits the people of God. It should include exercises of worship and spiritual devotion, both public and private.
Civil Government. We believe civil government exists by divine appointment for the benefit and good order of human society. Government officials are to be regularly prayed for, conscientiously honoured, and respectfully obeyed. The principle exception is for matters contrary to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only Lord of the conscience, and the Prince of the kings of the earth.
The Righteous and the Wicked. We believe there is a radical and essential difference between the righteous and the wicked. Only those who are justified by faith in the name of Jesus Christ and sanctified by the Spirit of our God are truly righteous in his judgement. In contrast, all those who continue in impenitence and unbelief are wicked in his sight and under the curse. This distinction among people holds both at death and afterward.
The World to Come. We believe the end of the world is approaching. At the last day, Christ will descend bodily from heaven and raise the dead bodily from the grave to final judgement. A separation will take place, in which the wicked will be justly assigned to eternal punishment and the righteous to eternal life. This judgement will be final and irreversible.

## 6. MEMBERSHIP OF THE CHURCH

Persons who, having declared their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and having confessed the same in baptism by immersion, give evidence of regeneration, and who wholeheartedly affirm the Christian faith as revealed in the holy Scriptures, may be admitted, by the church, into the membership of the church in accordance with the procedure below.
Each member must agree to submit to the teaching of the holy Scriptures as outlined in the declaration of belief (Clause 5) and promise to keep the commitments expressed in the church covenant (Annexure A).

### A. ADMISSION TO MEMBERSHIP

Persons interested in the membership of the church shall attend a membership information class (three separate teachings). The procedure for becoming a member shall be explained to them at this class.
Any person who, having attended all membership information classes, desires to join the membership shall express that desire to an elder of the church. The prospective member shall be assigned to an existing church member, who shall lead them through the introductory basics of church membership material required in the membership process.
When the applicant shall have completed the basics of church membership material, and the church member leading him or her through this material is happy to recommend him or her for membership, the prospective member shall be interviewed by the elders or an officer or officers designated by the elders. The interview shall include the reality of the person’s conversion, the present state of the person’s fellowship with the Lord and other believers, clear understanding and articulation of the gospel of Christ, and the person’s agreement with the church’s declaration of belief.
If the elders or interviewing officer(s) are satisfied that the applicant’s profession to faith is credible, the applicant’s name shall be made known to the church for no less than two Lord’s Days. The membership application shall then be presented to the church for approval and acceptance at a regularly scheduled service or members’ meeting. The applicant shall be required, upon acceptance into church membership, to sign the church covenant as outlined in Annexure A.
Persons accepted into membership of the church shall thereby relinquish membership of other churches.

### B. TRANSFER OF MEMBERSHIP

Members of churches of like faith, who seek fellowship with the church, may produce a letter of transfer from the church in which existing membership stands. This letter shall be submitted to the elders after which the procedure of Clause 6. A. shall be followed.

Persons transferring membership from a church of like faith shall be required to undergo the regular membership process, as outlined in Clause 6. A. The elders may agree on an abbreviated process in such cases.

### C. Duties and Privileges of Membership

1. As outlined in the church covenant (Annexure A), church members shall be privileged and expected to participate in and contribute to the ministry and life of the church, consistent with God’s leading and with the member’s gifts, time, and God-given material resources.

2. Only church members and persons undergoing the membership process shall be privileged to serve in the ministries of the church. Visiting members of likeminded churches and other non-members may serve the church’s ministry with the approval of the elders. Non-members may serve the church for the purposes of administration and professional consultation.

3. Under the authority of Jesus Christ and the holy Scriptures, the church is governed by its members. Church members therefore have the privileged responsibility of exercising the keys to the Kingdom, to attend members’ meetings and vote on the election of officers, decisions regarding membership status, and any other matters that may be submitted to a vote.

### D. Termination of Membership

The church shall recognise the termination of a person’s membership following his or her death, and shall also recognise termination of membership upon transfer of church membership to a church of like faith (limited to a maximum period of three months) or in the final step of church discipline, as outlined in Clause 7 below.

Since church membership is a covenant relationship, the church shall have the authority to refuse a member’s voluntary resignation or transfer of membership to another church, either for the purpose of proceeding with a process of church discipline, or for any other biblical reason.

Except in the case of a member’s death, where termination of membership is automatic, and in extreme circumstances in which a special members’ meeting may be called for, termination of church membership shall take place at a regularly-scheduled service or members’ meeting of the church.

## 7. CHURCH DISCIPLINE

Any member who is guilty of heretical doctrine or unrepentant, sinful conduct by which the name of Jesus Christ is dishonoured, or who is consistently neglectful of his or her membership duties and who thereby opposes the welfare of the church and/or renders doubtful his or her profession of faith, shall be subject to the processes of church discipline outlined in the New Testament (Matthew 18:15–20; 1 Corinthians 5:6–13; Galatians 6:1–2; Thessalonians 3:14–15; Titus 3:10–11).

While the elders shall offer leadership in this process, church discipline is the responsibility of the congregation.

Church discipline may include

- admonition of the erring member by the elders or the congregation (Matthew 18:15–20)
- suspension from Communion for a defined period
- removal from church office (1 Timothy 5:19–20)
- and/or formal excommunication from church membership (1 Corinthians 5:4–5).

### A. The Purpose of Church Discipline

The threefold purpose of church discipline is

- (1) to glorify God by reflecting his holy character in maintaining purity in the church (1 Corinthians 5:6)

- (2) to edify believers by deterring sin (1 Timothy 5:20), and

- (3) to promote the spiritual welfare of the offending member by calling him or her to repentance and return to a biblical standard of doctrine and conduct (Galatians 6:1)

### B. The Procedure for Church Discipline

1. The ordinary process of church discipline, both formative and corrective, is outlined in Matthew 18:15–20. Nevertheless, the church recognises that there may be times where other procedures are called for, as outlined, for example, in 1 Corinthians 5:6–13 or Titus 3:10–11. The elders shall offer scriptural leadership to the church, which shall commit to following biblical procedures in all matters relating to church discipline.

### C. The Restoration or Dismissal of Members

1. If an erring individual demonstrates repentance, notice to that effect may be given at a regularly scheduled service or members’ meeting.

2. If an erring individual refuses to repent in response to the church’s collective call to repentance, then he or she shall be publicly dismissed from the fellowship and/or membership of the church at a regularly scheduled service or members’ meeting.

3. If the erring individual, following removal from fellowship and/or membership, heeds the warnings of the church, expresses and demonstrates repentance, and requests reinstatement, the elders shall propose to the church that he or she be publicly welcomed back into fellowship and restored to all the rights, duties, privileges, and responsibilities of membership. If the church agrees, the repentant member shall be welcomed back into membership at a regularly scheduled service or members’ meeting of the church.

4. The members of this church agree that there shall be no appeal to any court because of the removal or because of public statements to the congregation at any point in the disciplinary process.

5. Members who are under discipline by the church, as defined above, forfeit and waive the right to resign from the church.

## MEETINGS

The church shall meet together for worship, to discuss and vote on matters related to membership and ministry, and to conduct business. In every meeting together, members shall act in a spirit of mutual trust, openness, and loving consideration, which is appropriate to the body of Christ.

## WORSHIP MEETINGS

Worship services shall be held each Lord’s Day, and may be held throughout the week as the church determines. Unless providentially hindered, members shall attend worship meetings; notwithstanding, non-members are welcome to attend the regularly-scheduled worship services of the church.

## MEMBERS’ MEETINGS

Regular members’ meetings shall be held at least once a quarter, at a time apart from the regular corporate worship. These meetings shall ordinarily be held on the evening service of the Lord’s Day, following the evening morning? corporate gathering, but may be convened at other times upon the request of the elders or members as outlined below. The annual general meeting shall form the first of these quarterly meetings each year. Members’ meetings called on any day of the week, other than the Lord’s Day, shall be subject to written notice given on two successive Sundays before the day appointed for the meeting. Such notice shall be stated in the announcements and/or affixed to the notice board.
An elder/s designated by the eldership shall preside as moderator at all members’ meetings. The elders shall see that the stated meetings of the church are regularly held and that all required business is conducted according to biblical standards and the requirements of the constitution of the church.
Provided all constitutional provisions for notification have been met, a quorum shall be understood to be met by those members present.

At any regular or special members’ meeting, officers may be elected and positions filled as required, provided that all constitutional requirements have been met.

Special members’ meetings may be convened any time by the elders, or may be convened upon a request by a member in writing signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the members qualified to vote at such meetings. In the event of a written request from members for a special meeting, the elders shall call for such a meeting within one month of their receipt of the written request.
Unless otherwise specified in the constitution of the church or agreed upon by the members of the church, voting at members’ meetings shall be by means of a voice vote or raising of hands. Votes shall be taken by ballot if demanded by not less than ten percent (10%) of the members present at a meeting who are qualified to vote at such meeting. Voting by ballot shall also apply when the pastors/elders of the church deem it necessary. Members under the age of sixteen eighteen may attend members’ meetings but may not vote.

All votes shall be tallied based on the number of votes cast by members present. Unless otherwise stated in this constitution, or agreed upon by the church, a resolution shall be passed by a majority of members present at the meeting or by official proxy. Resolutions passed shall be considered binding until rescinded at a later meeting of the members.

A budget shall be approved by the members at the fourth quarterly members’ meeting each year. The proposed budget, having been formulated by the elders in conjunction with the accountant, and having taken into account budget requests from the members, shall be circulated to the membership by reasonable means not less than one calendar month two Lord’s Days prior to the fourth quarterly meeting, and opportunity shall be given in the intervening period to ask questions, make suggestions, and seek clarification. A vote shall be taken at the meeting to ratify the proposed budget.

## TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS

Subject to the will of the church, the elders and deacons, together with any other administrative officer appointed by the church, have authority to transact the business of the church, administer its funds, and carry out its directions in accordance with the congregation-approved budget and the conditions of the constitution of the church.
The necessary funds for the work of the church shall be raised by free will offerings and tithes. No funds shall be raised in any other manner except with the consent of the elders.
No disposal of church movable or immovable property or borrowing or capital purchase from church funds in excess of Fifty Thousand Rand (R1050,000) per item, exclusive of interest and taxation thereon, shall be valid except upon the authority of a resolution passed at a members’ meeting of the church. Such amount shall be escalated cumulatively by 15% (fifteen five percent) per annum (beginning in 2020002).

## CHURCH OFFICERS AND STAFF

The authority to affirm officers is vested in the congregation. The New Testament recognises two officers of the local church: elders (also called pastors or overseers) and deacons. The church may recognise other administrative positions, such as pastoral assistants and accountant the church secretary. All officers of the church must be church members prior to assuming their responsibilities, and must remain church members for the duration of the time in which they serve in their individual capacities. Dismissal from membership for disciplinary purposes shall immediately be considered removal from any official capacity in the church.
ELDERS (PASTORS or OVERSEERS)
In accordance with clear, New Testament principles, the oversight of the church rests with its elders, all of whom are equal in authority, ministering in a plurality of leadership. The structure of New Testament church government is a collective leadership in which each elder shares equally the position, authority, and responsibility of the office.
TERMINOLOGY REGARDING ELDERS
Elders are designated by three terms in the New Testament, each of which highlights a distinct responsibility of those in this office: “overseer” (“bishop”), one who gives oversight to the welfare of the church; “elder,” one who gives mature leadership to the church; and “pastor” (“shepherd”), one who shepherds and feeds the flock.
While the most common term used by the church to refer to its leaders is “elders,” this is not intended in any way to create an unbiblical distinction between pastors and elders.
Jesus Christ is the Chief Shepherd—the supreme Head and Leader of the church—and the elders serve as his under-shepherds. The elders are therefore responsible to Christ rather than to a “senior” pastor.
QUALIFICATIONS FOR ELDERS
The qualifications for the office of elder are specifically set forth in 1 Timothy 3:1–7; Titus 1:5–11; and 1 Peter 5:1–4. They are qualifications of ethical behaviour, knowledge of Christian doctrine, and sound family life. Elders must be “above reproach” (1 Timothy 3:2) because they are to wield godly influence for the church, and bring no reproach to the name of Christ. They are men who are able to teach, model a godly family life, are firmly committed to living out our Lord’s principles of discipleship, and who seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness (Matthew 6:33). They are men who love Jesus Christ above all else and who willingly sacrifice themselves for the sake of others, even to suffer for Christ. They are men who are known to commit themselves to prayer.
The list of qualifications for those who shall oversee the local church presupposes males. The New Testament teaches male headship in both the family and the church. First Timothy 2:11–14 expressly forbids women to teach or to exercise authority over men in the corporate gathering of the church.
Prospective elders are to be publicly examined in the light of biblical qualifications. The number of elders is not limited, but shall depend on the number of men the Lord calls and the church affirms.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF ELDERS
Subject to the will of the congregation, the elders shall oversee the ministry and resources of the church. In keeping with the principles set forth in Acts 6:1–6 and 1 Peter 5:1–4, the elders shall devote their time to prayer, the ministry of the word (by teaching and encouraging sound doctrine), and shepherding God’s flock.
The elders shall take particular responsibility to examine and instruct prospective members, examine and recommend all prospective candidates for offices and positions, oversee the work of the deacons and appointed church agents and committees, conduct worship services, administer the ordinances of baptism and Communion, equip the membership for the work of the ministry, encourage sound doctrine and practice, admonish and correct error, oversee the process of church discipline, coordinate and promote the ministries of the church, and mobilise the church for world missions. The elders are further to ensure that all who minister the word to the congregation, including outside speakers, share our fundamental convictions.
The elders may establish ministry positions or committees to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities. The elders may also propose funding for new paid staff positions. The scope and approval of job descriptions for any staff position shall reside in the hands of those with hiring authority for that position.
The elders shall have primary responsibility for the employment, supervision, and evaluation of staff members. This responsibility may, on a case-by-case basis, be delegated to another staff member.
The elders shall meet as often as the proper fulfilment of their responsibilities may require.
SELECTION OF ELDERS
A member who desires the office of elder and is confident that he fulfils the biblical requirements for the office may approach any of the elders to express his desire to serve in that capacity.
If any of the elders believe that a man’s life and ministry indicate that he may be a suitable candidate, he may put the man’s name before the elders for consideration. If, after due consideration, the elders concur, the proposer may approach the man to suggest that he give prayerful consideration to joining the eldership.
Any member of the church who has the right to vote at meetings may at any time make recommendation in writing to the elders. If the elders concur that the proposed man may be a suitable candidate, one of the elders shall approach him for discussion.
A member who agrees to pursue the office of elder shall enter an eldership candidacy process. His name shall be made known to the church as an elder candidate. As a candidate, he shall attend elders’ meetings and receive exposure to shepherding and teaching ministry. Candidates shall, at the discretion of the elders, be excused from elders’ meetings during particularly sensitive matters of discussion.
There is no set time for the eldership candidacy. Once the elders are satisfied that an individual does indeed meet the requirements of Scripture for the pastorate, the elders shall, at a regularly-scheduled service or members’ meeting, formally propose the candidate’s name to the church for consideration as an elder. The proposal, including the candidate’s name, shall be published in the church bulletin for no less than four weeks Lord’s Days.
During this time, members shall be invited to raise any objections—in terms of 1 Timothy 3:1–7, Titus 1:5–9, and 1 Peter 5:1–4—to the appointment of the candidate as an elder. If no grounds for disqualification are found, the elders shall assume that the congregation concurs with the proposal, and the candidate’s call shall be affirmed at a regularly-scheduled service or members’ meeting of the church.
The candidate shall subsequently be ordained to the office during a normal Sunday morning service by the laying on of hands and prayer by the pastors/elders.
VOCATIONAL ELDERS
Elders shall serve without remuneration, except in cases where it is felt by the elders and the congregation that it shall be advantageous to the life and ministry of the church, in keeping with a congregation-approved budget, that such elders should be enabled to give undivided attention to the work and ministry of the church. Any proposal to vocationally employ an elder shall be made at a regularly-scheduled members’ meeting and be ratified by the membership no sooner than the following regularly-scheduled members’ meeting.
A vocational elder’s salary shall be determined by a salary committee elders comprising of non-staff elders, the accountant, and any other men appointed by the eldership to this responsibility. Vocational elders shall be granted a one-to-three month sabbatical every five-to-seven years. A sabbatical is not primarily a time of holiday, but a period of focused study and learning. Its design is to make a significant contribution to the vocational elder’s ongoing formation and vision of the church by developing knowledge, skills and insights. The vocational elders’ handbook outlines other privileges and responsibilities of vocational elders.
A vocational elder shall remain in office as long as he is a member and continues to meet the biblical requirements, or resigns the office, or disqualifies himself. Any engagement between the church and a vocational elder shall be terminated by three months’ notice in writing by either party, unless otherwise mutually agreed.
NON-VOCATIONAL ELDERS
Biblically qualified and called men, who are members of, but not vocationally employed by, the church may be appointed to serve as elders in accordance with the selection process outlined above. Non-vocational elders shall bear the same authority and responsibilities as vocational elders.
Non-vocational elders shall be appointed to serve a term of three years. A non-vocational elder may serve a maximum of two three-year terms before taking a mandatory one-year sabbatical from the office of elder. Assuming he remains qualified, he may be nominated and re-affirmed as an elder after his one-year sabbatical.
TEACHING ELDERS
Although elders act jointly as a body and share equal authority and responsibility for the leadership of the church, they are not equal in giftedness, biblical knowledge, leadership ability, experience, or dedication. Therefore, those who are particularly gifted leaders and/or teachers stand out in the body of elders as leaders and teachers as “firsts among equals,” a pattern which was seen even among our Lord’s disciples.
The concept of “first among equals” is underlined in the words of 1 Timothy 5:17–18, where we see that teaching pastors are to be given double honour. This allows the spiritual giftedness of these pastors to foster the spiritual growth of the church.
The principle of “first among equals” allows for functional, gift-based diversity within the pastoral team without creating an official, superior office of one elder over fellow elders. The pastors who labour in the word and exercise good leadership are, in the words of Scripture, “leading men among the brothers” (Acts 15:22).
The one seen as “first among equals” in this sense may be regarded as a leader of leaders, but is an elder himself and has no greater authority than any of the other elders.
APPOINTMENT OF A PASTOR IN THE ABSENCE OF ELDERS
The existing elders shall lead the congregation in the selection of elder candidates. If there are no elders in the church then the following procedure shall be followed.
A general meeting for the purpose of electing a pastor shall be called by the diaconate, at which the members shall appoint not less than six church members (who are not deacons) to act with the diaconate as a special calling committee. The members proposed for this calling committee shall be voted on at the above-mentioned general meeting. The members shall be individually accepted with a two-third majority of members present and eligible to vote.
The duty of the calling committee shall be to make all necessary enquiries and to agree upon a prospective pastor with an eighty percent (80%) majority. The calling committee’s decision shall be recommended to the church as soon as possible. The calling committee shall put before the church only one prospective pastor at a time.
The calling committee’s recommendation shall be considered at a general meeting called for the purpose of appointing a pastor and no invitation shall be sent forward unless eighty (80%) percent of the members present vote in favour. Forty (40%) percent of the membership of the church shall be deemed to constitute a quorum at a general meeting called for this purpose.
An invitation shall be contingent upon the prospective pastor accepting in writing the provisions on the constitution of the church, a copy of which shall be supplied for his perusal.
DEACONS
The deacons shall consist of members, over the age of 21, and who have been church members for no less than one year, possessing the qualifications described in 1 Timothy 3:8–13. Deacons elected by the church shall be members who are giving of themselves in service to the church, and who possess particular gifts of service. These members shall be received as gifts of Christ to his church and set apart as deacons. Deacons shall be elected to a term lasting two years, after which they shall retire from office. A retired deacon may be re-elected to office upon retirement, subject to the will of the church.
Deacons shall operate under the broad oversight of the eldership but may, with the agreement of the elders, establish unpaid administrative positions or committees of members to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities in the church.
There is no limit on the number of deacons who may serve the church at any given time, but deacons shall be appointed to meet particular administrative, ministerial, and benevolent needs as they arise. Deacons may be affirmed by the church at any regular members’ meeting, or at a special members’ meeting called for the purpose of appointing deacons, after the church has been informed of the nomination by no later than the Sunday prior to the members’ meeting in question.
PASTORAL ASSISTANTS
The elders may hire additional staff to assist with pastoral ministry, subject to a congregation-approved budget.

ANNEXURE A.
The Brackenhurst Baptist Church Membership Covenant
By God’s grace, we are gathered as those who have repented and believed in the Lord Jesus Christ. We have given ourselves to him and affirmed one another as citizens of his kingdom through baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Relying on his gracious aid, we do now solemnly and joyfully renew our covenant with each other.
We will work and pray for the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace.
We will walk together in love as Christ commands, caring for each other, watching over each other, and encouraging and admonishing one another as occasion requires.
We will regularly attend the church’s gatherings and faithfully pray for one another.
We will endeavour to lead those in our care in the discipline and instruction of the Lord, as well as to seek the salvation of our family and friends.
We will rejoice at each others’ happiness and bear each others’ burdens and sorrows.
With God’s help, we will live carefully in the world, denying ungodliness and worldly desires. Our symbolic burial and resurrection in baptism testifies to this special obligation to live a new and holy life.
We will work together to maintain a faithful gospel witness in our worship, ordinances, discipline, and doctrines. We will contribute cheerfully to the expenses of the church, the needs of our neighbours, and the spread of the gospel around the world.
If we leave this congregation, we will join another gospel-preaching church as soon as possible where we can carry out the spirit of this covenant and the principles of God’s word.
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with us all. Amen.
